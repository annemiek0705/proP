Join your favourite artists in the first annual DDD – Dance Dance Dance, the biggest music festival of the year! 
Because this is the first of our festivals we’re going in big with the most popular groups and artists from every genre. What we aim to accomplish by this is not only attract as many people as possible but also offer people the chance to try a bit of everything. Where else can you attend a Beyonce concert at 6 and then an AC/DC concert at 9?
We from ConnectTech and our partners invite you to a once-in-a-lifetime experience, an unforgettable weekend filled with countless great memories!
